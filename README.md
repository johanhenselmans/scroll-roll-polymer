x-roll Polymer
==========
x-roll Polymer is the polymer-dart implementation of a scroll wheel. 

Originally this started as a swipe example, in the Dart example collection

I decided to have a better purpose for it a showing of a caroussel of images...

the focus on the div so that the keystrokes will only be listened on on this element is done via tabindex="-1"
